# WeaveDevDocs
Welcome to the documentation for Weave 1.0 development. Here, I will walk you through the creation of your first Weave mod and the Weave API.
# Setting up Weave
[Weave Manager](https://github.com/Weave-MC/Weave-Manager/releases) (Download corresponding version for your OS)<br /><br />
To use Weave Manager, all you have to do is launch your version and client of choice, then find the process in Weave Manager and click create profile, then you can add your mods in the mods tab and click launch on the profile. That's it.
# Support
Weave supports Yarn and MCP mappings depending on what version you are developing for, this guide goes over development for 1.8.9, but it should be fairly easy to adapt your mod to work for the later versions. Weave supports versions 1.7-1.20, on Vanilla, LabyMod 4, Lunar Client and Forge. <br /><br />
